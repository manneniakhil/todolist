TO DO LIST
The to-do list project is a simple, interactive web application designed to help users manage their tasks. It features an elegantly styled interface where users can add tasks through an input field and a dedicated "Add Task" button. Each task appears as a list item within a visually appealing container. Tasks can be marked as completed, which visually strikes them through, indicating their completion status. Additionally, each task comes with a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove tasks from the list. The application stores tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the user's list persists between page reloads. This project showcases fundamental web development concepts, including HTML structure, CSS styling for aesthetics, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality and local storage integration.
